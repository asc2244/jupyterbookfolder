    "As a native New Yorker (proudly born and raised in Queens), I was interested in creating a data visualization that focused on a unique aspect of growing up in the city: the SHSAT. The SHSAT (Specialized High School Admissions Test) is a high school entrance exam that's required to attend 8 out of 9 academically specialized high schools in NYC. The only one that doesn't require the test for admissions is LaGuardia High School (which I attended for piano!). Studying for the SHSAT was a big part of my (and many other NYC kids') childhood - therefore, I wanted to focus my project on this! Specifically, I was curious to understand whether or not SHSAT participation rates changed during the pandemic. Did schools see more or less people take the test after COVID? Or did the pandemic not affect participation rates at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "I used two datasets to conduct my analysis: \"2018-2019 SHSAT Admissions Test Offers By Sending School\" and \"2020-2021 SHSAT Admissions Test Offers By Sending School.\" Both datasets record the number of people who take the SHSAT in each NYC school, using a DBN code as the school identifier. However, the only difference between them is that one captures data from the 2018-19 academic year and the other from the 2020-21 academic year. Since this data is longitudinal, meaning that the two datasets record data from the same schools over time, I realized that I could focus my data visualization project on understanding if SHSAT participation rates changed in each school on an individual level before and after COVID.\n"

The datasets didn't record a specific number for schools that had less than 5 students take the SHSAT in the number of testers columns (they recorded this as \"0-5\"). Rather than hardcode a specific value into these columns in place of \"0-5\", I decided to drop the entire rows for simplicity (i.e. exclude the schools that had less than 5 test takers in both years). \n",

I had to create two separate for loops (one for each column) to do this, because including two if statements in one loop started having the code override each other and created a bunch of errors. However, these errors were gone once I removed the hyphens from one column first and then remove the hyphens from the other column afterwards (rather than simultaneously).\n",

It surprised me that overall there are more schools with only 0-50 students taking the SHSAT per year than schools with 100+ students taking the exam. This make sense though since the SHSAT is an exam that skews towards wealthier, more privileged students who can afford test prep and tutors, and the majority of NYC schools do not have a very high-income population.
